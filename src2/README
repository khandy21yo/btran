This directory contains the source code for the actual translator itself,
and a filter to convert old style basic programs to something acceptable
to VaxBasic.


This version is where I attempt to "improve" the current version with "better"
methods, and to clean up the code.

Hopefully this will eventually be a better version of the original one.
