This subdirectory contains assorted sampla basic
programs that compile and run without modification
of the generated c++ files. The makefile shows
several ways of using the translator, and lets you
compare the original source to the generated c++
code.

Some bugs occur because of differences in how C++ and
Basic expect things to work. For example, Basic puts
spaces aroung numbers when printed, ans C++ foes not.
Basic allows multiple  inputs to be entered seperated
by commas, and C++ wants them entered seperately.

These programs are either from public domain sources,
or are my own creations.

Several of these need to be passed hrough the b1filter
program wich converts older Basic+ format, which used
colons for the statement seerator, to the Basic+2
format which uses a back-slash seperator.

Just type 'make' to generate all the c++ source, and
binary executables.

amazin.bas	101 Basic Computer Games
		A maze generating program
amazin2.cc	amazin.bas
		I took the code generated drom amazin.bas. and hand edited
		it to make it less spagetti code. The origibal junps around
		too much to be understandable.
kmaze.bas	Kevin Handy
		A maze building program
		** Top row of maze is wrong
morgul.bas	This ia not actually a program. It
		is a data file for trek.bas. I don't
		know why it is called what it is.
revrse.bas	101 Basic Compuer Games
		A reverse the digits gane
		** Doesnt show spaces around numbers
snak.bas	Kevin Handy
		Another maze generator
snoopy.bas	101 Basic Computer Games
		Print a simple poster
		** The things that used to amuse us
trek.bas	A version of Star Trek gane that was
		available locally. It mostly works, but
		has issues. It needs to run in a subdirectory
		with morgul.bas in it. Some things are still
		broken in the translation.
superstartrek	Another version of trek.
		Larger programs like this help be locate problems.
		It is mostly functional. 
		It sometimes locks up at the start.
		Problems incluse use of TAB(), odd usage of RIGHT.
		Some code patched to fix bugs caused by these, and DIM
		statements added.
moon.bas	This is a program from a decus tape.
		I had to modify it sligtly for the translator.
		Added '&' line continuation markers, and changed the
		print using "//" to "\\".
		For dates wanting "MON,DY,YR", enter each part on a seperate
		lline because CC++ doesn't understand commas.
