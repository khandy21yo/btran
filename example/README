This subdirectory contains assorted sampla basic
programs that compile and run without modification
of the generated c++ files. The makefile shows
several ways of using the translator, and lets you
compare the original source to the generated c++
code.

Some bugs occur because of differences in how C++ and
Basic expect things to work. For example, Basic puts
spaces aroung numbers when printed, ans C++ foes not.
Basic allows multiple  inputs to be entered seperated
by commas, and C++ wants them entered seperately.

These programs are either from public domain sources,
or are my own creations.

Several of these need to be passed hrough the b1filter
program wich converts older Basic+ format, which used
colons for the statement seerator, to the Basic+2
format which uses a back-slash seperator.

Just type 'make' to generate all the c++ source, and
binary executables.
