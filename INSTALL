------

Old automake/autoconf method. May not work. Never quite did the right things.

Tools you will need to build

	automake
	autoconf
	libtool
	flex
	bison
	libboost

Configure and build from base drectory

	./makeall

Translate code

	~/btran/src/btran < test.bas > test.cc
	g++ -I ~/btran/lib test.cc ~/btran/lin/libtran.a
